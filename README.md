# Agro Chain ( built in HackShef8 )
Empowering Farmers and Buyers in a Trustworthy Multi-Supply Chain Ecosystem
Within the agricultural industry, prevalent uncertain agreements and biased payments highlight a critical need for heightened assurance and security in transactions. Ambiguities in dealings between farmers and merchants necessitate a framework that ensures transparency, reliability, and fair practices. Prioritizing assurance and security aims to fortify economic foundations, creating an environment where contractual agreements are transparent, payments are equitable, and the agricultural industry flourishes on the pillars of integrity and fairness.

AgroChain is a decentralized application (dApp) designed to streamline and enhance the agricultural supply chain, ensuring a seamless and trustworthy experience for both farmers and buyers. Our platform not only facilitates efficient transactions but also addresses keychallenges in the agricultural sector by integrating smart contracts and a reliable lending system
